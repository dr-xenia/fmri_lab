# Setting up the tutorial environment

## Binder

Using Binder is the easiest and fastest way to get started with the workshop. Binder is a virtual environment containing the full computing environment required in order to go through the workshop. Note that Binder hosts the environment on a cloud server and therefore internet access is required to launch it.

### Setting up Binder


Click the link here to spin up the workshop environment: [Binder Workshop](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dr-xenia/fmri_lab/HEAD)]
You will see an interface that looks like the following:
